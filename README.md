# Recipe Manager
[recipemanager.io](https://recipemanager.io/)

Recipe Manager is a cross-platform application for managing recipes in teams. It features high security, real-time updates and a convergent UI design. **Most of these features have yet to be implemented.**

The project is an attempt on making real-time secure network communication in Qt easier. It is a combination of both, a server side app written in Golang and a client side app in Qt (C++/QML).

## Specifications
Specifications for the project, including it's network communication protocol, will be provided in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/evanlinjin/recipe-manager/wiki) for this repo.

These are rather incomplete for the time being.
