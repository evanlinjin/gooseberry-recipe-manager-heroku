# Recipe Manager
*** Very Early Alpha - Useless for the end user. ***

This project is a combination of both, a server side app written in Golang and a client side app in Qt (C++/QML).

The application itself is for managing recipes in teams, featuring high security, realtime updates, and also offline access.
