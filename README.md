***Very Early Stages of Development - Useless for the end user.***

Recipe Manager is a cross-platform application for managing recipes in teams. It features high security, real-time updates and a convergent UI design. Of course, for the time being, most of these features have yet to be implemented.

The project is an attempt on making real-time secure network communication in Qt easier. It is a combination of both, a server side app written in Golang and a client side app in Qt (C++/QML).
